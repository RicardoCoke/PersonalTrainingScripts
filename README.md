File : dataFromStrongUpdated <br />
Inputting a csv file (from FitNotes or Strong) converts it's data into a generic format (formatting data that's from Android or IOS). <br />
The generic format data is then used to generate a XLS file with the pretended main exercises, with the variance of the exercise repetitions, weight and total volume.
